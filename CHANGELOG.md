## 1.20.0 (2026-07-17)

### Security

* This release includes an important security fix. Please update as soon as possible. Sensitive Matrix account data is not exposed by this issue. ([#1107](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1107>) by @7w1)

### Features

* Add Native OIDC (OAuth 2.0) login so you can sign in to and register on homeservers that use delegated authentication, such as continuwuity and Synapse with the Matrix Authentication Service. Sessions stay signed in through automatic token refresh, and signing out revokes the tokens on the server. ([#1071](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1071>) by @eleboucher)
* Show the unread mention count in the page title. ([#1093](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1093>) by @eleboucher)

#### Improve sliding sync. ([#1069](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1069>) by @7w1, @eleboucher)

- Make sliding sync easier to enable during login or loading and from settings.
- Move the sliding sync toggle from Experimental to the bottom of General settings.
- Start faster and restore rooms and spaces sooner.
- Reduce unnecessary background room data.
- Improve room details, memberships, presence, and unread indicators.
- Make startup loading smoother for both sliding and classic sync.
- It's fast now :3

### Fixes

* Allow users without a locally configured LiveKit focus to join calls started by others. ([#1099](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1099>) by @7w1)
* Fix the new messages divider not appearing when the read receipt points at an event hidden from the timeline (reaction, edit, thread reply). ([#1101](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1101>) by @eleboucher)
* Fix the new messages divider staying at the room-open position instead of re-anchoring at the last read when the window loses focus. ([#1095](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1095>) by @eleboucher)
* Fix redacted messages rendering as "Unsupported message (no body)" instead of "Message deleted" with sliding sync. ([#1089](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1089>) by @eleboucher)
* Display redacted state events (membership, room name/topic/avatar, pins and other state events) as a "deleted" tombstone in the timeline instead of rendering them with empty/redacted content or hiding them, so the reply-to of a redaction highlights the redacted event. ([#1090](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1090>) by @eleboucher)
* Fix joining spaces with sliding sync enabled. ([#1085](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1085>) by @eleboucher)

* Fix clickable handles ([#1068](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1068>) by @nushea)
* Hide the "Register" link on the login page when the homeserver has registration disabled and offers no SSO to register through, so you are no longer sent to a dead-end registration page. ([#1073](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1073>) by @eleboucher)
* Add uploaded Sable CSS theme loading, automatic catalog updates, and a cleaner theme browser with full CSS viewing. ([#1087](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1087>) by @7w1)
* Show room members in developer tools. ([#1088](<https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/1088>) by @7w1)

#### Themes and tweaks from the catalog ([#633](https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/633) by @7w1)

Themes are pulled from [a repo](https://github.com/SableClient/themes) now, so you get the full power of CSS instead of a palette. Tweaks are new: CSS overlays that sit on top of whatever theme you are using.

You'll be prompted to migrate to the new system whenever you update, if you choose not to, you'll be limited to the basic dark/light themes. A few additional themes have been added (Rose Pine variantes, Catpuccin) along with some basic tweaks (circular avatars, monochrome avatars, and square stuff).

You can share themes and tweaks. For themes uploaded online, simply hit the copy button in settings and paste the link in chat. If the setting is enabled, a preview will be generated. Third party themes (as defined by the config.json) have prominent warning banners and fetching is disabled by default.

You can also export and share theme files directly, although no previews are generated for these.

If you're intrested in getting a theme or tweak added to the official catalog, contribute to the themes repo linked above! We're eager to add more!

#### Markdown parser and render updates ([#727](https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/727) by @7w1)

Migrated markdown parsing and rendering to use marked, which should fix most (all?) markdown issues involving lists/nested structures, inconsistent/inaccurate code blocks, escape sequences, and all the other bugs with literally everything.

Added math rendering support via marked and KaTeX, uses standard `$$` and `$` delimiters. Only renders a subset of latex tags that will likely need to be expanded so feel free to make issues if needed.

Also adds support for sending markdown tables (although they're rendered rather plainly at the moment), sending valid html directly (such as for colored text), and properly escaping anything with backslashes.

Fixes link previews appearing in code blocks, fixes pmp new line behavior, fixes links not opening in new tabs, and fixes editing arbitrary html messages, probably.

Finally, the old WYSIWYG editor has been completely removed.

* Fix Workbox precaching by removing injectionPoint override that was silently disabling all precache entries ([#611](https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/611) by @Just-Insane)

#### Change how settings links are shared ([#695](https://github.com/SableClient/Sable/pull/695) by @hazre)

Settings links copied from Sable now stay on the current client URL and include a small Sable marker in the link. That lets Sable recognize settings links copied from other Sable instances without treating unrelated third-party `/settings/...` links as Sable settings links.

When you send a bare settings link in the composer, Sable now rewrites it into a labeled link so it looks better on non-Sable clients too. For example: `[Settings > Account > Display Name](https://client.example/settings/account?focus=display-name&moe.sable.client.action=settings)`.

Invalid or malformed settings-looking links now stay normal links instead of being shown as settings chips.

If you previously set `settingsLinkBaseUrl` in `config.json`, remove it. Sable now derives settings links from the runtime app URL, and the old config key is no longer used.

* Rename gcolor, gfont, and gpronoun commands to scolor, sfont, and spronoun respectively.
* Improved emoji board performance by deferring image pack cache reads so the board opens instantly rather than blocking on the initial render.
* Fix dm room nicknames applying to non-dm private rooms.
* Hide delete modal after successfully deleting a message.
* Fixed media authentication handling: removed unnecessary redirect following, added error fallback UI for failed media loads, and ensured authentication headers are applied consistently when rendering inline media in HTML message bodies.
* Failed message retry and delete actions now use Chip buttons for visual consistency with the rest of the interface.
* Adds a new message pill and background app highlighted unread count.
* Mobile: changed scheduled send chevron to tap + hold
* Reply quotes now automatically retry decryption for E2EE messages, display a distinct placeholder for replies from blocked users, and fix edge cases where reply event loading could silently fail.
* Service worker push notifications now correctly deep-link to the right account and room on cold PWA launch. Notifications are automatically suppressed when the app window is already visible. The In-App (pill banner) and System (OS) notification settings are now independent: desktop shows both controls, mobile shows Push and In-App only. Tapping an in-app notification pill on mobile now opens the room timeline directly instead of routing through the space navigation panel.
* Fixed several room timeline issues with sliding sync: corrected event rendering order, more accurate scroll-to-bottom detection, phantom unread count clearing when the timeline is already at the bottom, and fixed pagination spinner state.
* In-app notification banners now appear for DMs by default, even without a mention or keyword match.
* Notification banner on desktop now defaults to off, consistent with push notification defaults.
* Fixed space room navigation when tapping an in-app notification banner for a room inside a space.
